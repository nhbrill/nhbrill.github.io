A hero of mine that inspired me to pursue a career in Software Engineering is my grandma, [Yvonne Brill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvonne_Brill).
She played a big part in my life when I was a kid, being an amazing grandma and the more I grew up the more she inspired me to always learn and innovate.
One of the most impactful memories I have of her was when I was little, witnessing her induction into the National Inventors Hall Of Fame for her work on rocket propulsion systems. This memory has guided my goals and aspirations, that I will contribute to society in the technical field as great or greater of an accomplishment as her, and make her proud.

I encourage everyone to learn more about my grandma's accomplishments in life, to inspire them to innovate and excel in any path no matter how impossible it may seem. In addition to being inducted into the National Inventors hall of fame she has earned the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, AIAA Wyld Propulsion Award, American Association of Engineering Societies John Fritz Medal, Harperâ€™s Bazaar and the DeBeers Corporation Diamond Superwoman Award, a lectureship in AIAA in her name, membership in the National Academy of Engineering, named fellowship in SWE, and was personally awarded by the President of the United States at the time, Barack Obama, the National Medal of technology and Innovation.
